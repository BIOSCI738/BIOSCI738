## Week 1

---
# Learning objectives

# R is the pheromone to RStudio's PDA.

.small[`R` is a language. Specifically a programming language; it's the way you can speak to your computer to ask it to carry out certain computations.

`RStudio` is an integrated development environment (IDE). This means it is basically an interface, albeit a fancy one, that makes it easier to communicate with your computer in the `R` language. The main benefit is the additional features it has that enable you to more efficiently *speak* `R`.

**Note** `R` and `RStudio` are two **different** pieces of software; for this course you are expected to download both. As you'd expect the PDA depends on the pheromones (i.e., `RStudio` depends on `R`) so you have to download `R` to use `RStudio`! ]

# Installing R and RStudio

As mentioned above `RStudio` depends on `R` so there is an order you should follow when you download these software.

 1. **Download and install `R`** by following [these instructions](https://cloud.r-project.org/). Make sure you choose the correct operating system.
 
 2. **Download and install `RStudio`** by [going here](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) choosing RStudio Desktop *Open Source License* **Free** and following instructions.

### Check all is working

  + Open up `RStudio` from your computer menu, the icon will look something like this <img src="https://vectorified.com/images/rstudio-icon-31.png" width="7%"> (**DO NOT** use this icon <img src="https://cdn.iconscout.com/icon/free/png-512/r-5-283170.png" width="4%"> this is a link to `R` and will only open a very basic interface)
  + Wait a little and you should see `RStudio` open up to something similar to the screenshot below

+ **Self-contained** a *project* is a folder that contains all relevant files

[Jenny Bryan will set your computer on fire](https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2017/12/workflow-vs-script/) `r emo::ji("fire")` if you start your script like this

```{r fire, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}

## Starting out with `tidyverse`

## Starting out with `tidyverse`

For EDA we will be using `tidyverse`. ['tidyverse'](https://www.tidyverse.org/) is a collection of `R` packages that all share underlying design philosophy, grammar, and data structures. They are specifically designed to make data wrangling, manipulation, visualisation, and analysis simpler.

To install **all** the packages that belong to the `tidyverse` run

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
## request (download) the tidyverse packages from the centralised library
install.packages("tidyverse")

```

To tell your computer to access the `tidyverse` functionality in your session run `r library(tidyverse)` (**Note** you'll have to do this each time you start up an `R` session):

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE}
## Get the tidyverse packages from our local library
library(tidyverse)

```

---
### Reading in data from a `.csv` file

First off download the `paua.csv` file from CANVAS 

To read the data into `RStudio` 

 1. In the *Environment* pane click **Import Dataset** >  ** From Text (readr)** > **Browse** > *Choose your file, remembering which folder you downloaded it to. this is where `.Rproj` is useful* > *Another pane should pop up, check the data looks as you might expect* > **Import**
 
 
```{r read quiet, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE, message = FALSE}
paua <- read_csv("../../BIOSCI220/data/paua.csv")
```

2. Or

```{r read demo, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE, message = FALSE}
paua <- read_csv("paua.csv")
```


---
## Explore your data

Let's have a look at your data in the *Console*

```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = TRUE}
paua
```

---
## Explore your data

Using the `glimpse()` command for an alternative view

```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = TRUE}
glimpse(paua)
```

---
### The pipe operator `%>%`

A nifty `tidyverse` tool is called the pipe operator `%>%`. The pipe operator allows us to combine multiple operations in `R` into a single sequential chain of actions.

Say you would like to perform a hypothetical sequence of operations on a hypothetical data frame x using hypothetical functions f(), g(), and h():

+ Take `x` then
+ Use `x` as an input to a function `f()` then
+ Use the output of this as an input to a function `g()` then
+ Use the output of this as an input to a function `h()`


---
class: inverse 

So to calculate the mean **Age** of each **Species** in the `paua` dataset we would use

```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = TRUE}
paua %>%
group_by(Species) %>%
summarize(mean_age = mean(Age))
```

You would read the sequence  above as:

+ Take the `paua` data.frame then
+ Use this and apply the `group_by()` function to group by `Species`
+ Use this output and apply the `summarize()` function to calculate the mean Age of each group (Species), calling the resulting number `mean_age`
