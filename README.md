+ Comparison procedures: pairwise comparisons of means, one-way ANOVA
+ Multiple comparison procedures (controlling errors in hypothesis testing) 
+ Multiple regression with continuous and categorical explanatory variables
+ Mixed models; incorporating fixed and random effects
+ Resampling procedures: randomisation, permutation, and bootstrapping

### Multivariate Analysis

+ Supervised learning: discriminant analysis
+ Networks and graphs

## Outline

This is a postgraduate course in statistical methods geared towards the needs of students of biology, ecology, and environmental science. Whether heading to research or industry, it is imperative that biology students have the statistical and computational skills to apply and interpret fundamental statistical concepts and analyses to assess and critique their experiments and other data.

This course is suited to students with an interest in (bio)statistics who would like to equip themselves with the tools and know-how to be able to correctly prepare experiments, analyse data, interpret their results and draw valid conclusions. The statistical concepts and methods taught in this course will provide students with the tools to make and evaluate scientific discoveries as well as propose and justify decisions based on data. Some basic statistical knowledg is assumed. 

This course will use the programming language R; R is a free software environment for statistical computing and graphics. Students are strongly encouraged to use R through the freely available IDE (integrated development environment) RStudio. Students will have access to R and RStudio in university computing laboratories, but are also encouraged to download and install R and RStudio on their own devices.

### Assignments and workshops

+ There will be 10 workshops (worth 0.5% each). These will take the form of worksheets, discussions, or MCQ quizzes; each will be designed to be completed within the dedicated lab time, and will be due 5pm on each Friday (weeks 2--11)
+ There will be 5 assignments throughout the semester, each with a peer review aspect. After each assignment has been handed out students will, typically, be given 2 weeks to complete (due 5pm on the Friday 2 weeks after). Sutudents will then be given 1 week to complete the peer review aspect of the assignment.
  - Each assignment will be based on a particular dataset and associated publication alongside the course matrerial They will be split into, roughly, four components:
   - MCQs based on EDA of the data
   - Pratical inferenc, using R
   - A longer form answer (e.g., CANVAS Discussion answer and/or CANVAS file upload) based on your own analysis of the data.
   - A peer review element


### Weekly overview

+ Note week 1 will have no lecture (due to SBS field trips) and the workshop/lab will the optional. There will, however, be a week 1 only extra credit assignment available.

+ Note also, week 12 will have a required lecture, however the review workshop/lab is optional.
