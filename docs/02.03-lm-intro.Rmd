## Linear regression

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cmjt/statbiscuits/master/figs_n_gifs/lm.gif)

### Some mathematical notation

Let's consider a linear regression with a simple explanatory variable:

$$Y_i = \alpha + \beta_1x_i + \epsilon_i$$
where

$$\epsilon_i \sim \text{Normal}(0,\sigma^2).$$

Here for observation $i$

  + $Y_i$ is the value of the response 
  + $x_i$ is the value of the explanatory variable 
  + $\epsilon_i$ is the error term: the difference between $Y_i$ and its expected value
  + $\alpha$ is the intercept term (a parameter to be estimated), and 
  + $\beta_1$ is the slope: coefficient of the explanatory variable (a parameter to be estimated)

Does this remind you of anything?

### Modeling Bill Depth 

**Remember the penguins from [Chapter 2](https://stats-uoa.github.io/BIOSCI220/data-exploration-and-visualization.html#data-wrangling-and-manipulation)**?

![](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/palmerpenguins/readme/man/figures/culmen_depth.png)

**Key assumptions**

+ **Independence** 
+ There is a **linear relationship** between the response and the explanatory variables
+ The residuals have **constant variance**
+ The **residuals** are normally distributed

```{r, message = FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(palmerpenguins)
penguins_nafree <- penguins %>% drop_na()
```

```{r, message=FALSE}
ggplot(data = penguins_nafree, aes(x = bill_depth_mm)) +
  geom_histogram() + theme_classic() +
  xlab("Bill depth (mm)")

```


First off let's fit a null (intercept only)  model. This in *old money* would be called a one sample t-test. 

```{r null}
slm_null <- lm(bill_depth_mm ~ 1, data = penguins_nafree)
summary(slm_null)$coef
```

**Model formula**

This model, from above, is simply $$Y_i = \alpha + \epsilon_i.$$ 

Here for observation $i$ $Y_i$ is the value of the response (`bill_depth_mm`) and $\alpha$ is a parameter to be estimated (typically called the intercept).


**Inference**

The `(Intercept)` term, `r summary(slm_null)$coef[1,1]`, tells us the (estimated) average value of the response (`bill_depth_mm`), see

```{r av}
penguins_nafree %>% summarise(average_bill_depth = mean(bill_depth_mm))
```

The SEM (`Std. Error`) = `r summary(slm_null)$coef[1,2]`. 

The hypothesis being tested is $H_0:$ (`(Intercept)` ) $\text{mean}_{\text{`average_bill_depth`}} = 0$ vs. $H_1:$ (`(Intercept)`) $\text{mean}_{\text{`average_bill_depth`}} \neq 0$ 

The t-statistic is given by `t value` = `Estimate` / `Std. Error` =  `r summary(slm_null)$coef[1,3]`

The p-value is given by`Pr (>|t|)` =  `r summary(slm_null)$coef[1,4]`.

So the probability of observing a t-statistic as least as extreme given under the null hypothesis (average bill depth = 0) given our data is `r summary(slm_null)$coef[1,4]`, pretty strong evidence against the null hypothesis I'd say!
	

### Single continuous variable

**Does `bill_length_mm` help explain some of the variation in `bill_depth_mm`?**

```{r}
p1 <- ggplot(data = penguins_nafree, aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = bill_depth_mm)) +
  geom_point() + ylab("Bill depth (mm)") +
  xlab("Bill length (mm)") + theme_classic()
p1
```

```{r slm}
slm <- lm(bill_depth_mm ~ bill_length_mm, data = penguins_nafree)
```



**Model formula**

This model is simply $$Y_i = \alpha + \beta_1x_i + \epsilon_i$$ where for observation $i$ $Y_i$ is the value of the response (`bill_depth_mm`) and $x_i$ is the value of the explanatory variable (`bill_length_mm`); As above $\alpha$ and $\beta_1$ are parameters to be estimated. We could also write this model as
  
  
```{r, echo = FALSE, results='asis'}
library(equatiomatic)
extract_eq(slm, wrap = TRUE)
```

**Fitted model**

As before we can get out estimated parameters (here $\alpha$ and $\beta_1$) using

```{r}
summary(slm)$coef
```

Here, the `(Intercept)`: `Estimate` ($\alpha$ above) gives us the estimated average bill depth (mm) **given the estimated relationship** bill length (mm) and bill length.

The `bill_length_mm` : `Estimate` ($\beta_1$ above) is the slope associated with bill length (mm). So, here for every 1mm increase in bill length we estimated a `r -1*round(summary(slm)$coef[2,1],3)`mm decrease (or a `r round(summary(slm)$coef[2,1],3)`mm increase) in bill depth.

```{r}
## calculate predicted values
penguins_nafree$pred_vals <- predict(slm)
## plot
ggplot(data = penguins_nafree, aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = bill_depth_mm)) +
  geom_point() + ylab("Bill depth (mm)") +
  xlab("Bill length (mm)") + theme_classic() +
  geom_line(aes(y = pred_vals))

```

### One factor and a continous variable

**Adding** `species`; remember `species` is a factor variable!

```{r}
p2 <- ggplot(data = penguins_nafree,
             aes(y = bill_depth_mm, x = bill_length_mm, color = species)) +
  geom_point() + ylab("Bill depth (mm)") +
  xlab("Bill length (mm)") + theme_classic()
p2
```

```{r}
slm_sp <- lm(bill_depth_mm ~ bill_length_mm + species, data = penguins_nafree)
```


**Model formula**

Now we have two explanatory variables, so our model formula becomes

$$Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1z_i + \beta_2x_i + \epsilon_i$$
$$\epsilon_i \sim \text{Normal}(0,\sigma^2)$$

where for observation $i$

  + $Y_i$ is the value of the response (`bill_depth_mm`)
  + $z_i$ is one explanatory variable (`bill_length_mm` say)
  + $x_i$ is another explanatory variable (`species` say)
  + $\epsilon_i$ is the error term: the difference between $Y_i$ and its expected value
  + $\alpha$, $\beta_1$, and $\beta_2$ are all parameters to be estimated.
  

Remember though that when we have factor explanatory variables (e.g., `species`) we have to use dummy variables, see lecture. Here the **Adelie** group are the baseline (`R` does this alphabetically, to change this see previous chapter).

So model formula is

```{r, echo = FALSE, results='asis'}
extract_eq(slm_sp, wrap = TRUE)
```

**Fitted model**


```{r}
summary(slm_sp)$coef
```


**Simpson's paradox...** look how the slope associated with bill length (coefficient of `bill_length_mm`) has switched direction from the model above! Why do you think this is?


Here, the `(Intercept)`: `Estimate` gives us the estimated average bill depth (mm) of the **Adelie** penguins **given the other variables in the model**.

The `bill_length_mm` : `Estimate` ($\beta_1$ above) is the slope associated with bill length (mm). So, here for every 1mm increase in bill length we estimated a `r round(summary(slm_sp)$coef[2,1],3)`mm increase in bill depth.

What about the coefficient of the other species levels? Look at the plot below, these values give the shift (up or down) of the **parallel** lines from the **Adelie** level. So given the estimated relationship between bill depth and bill length these coefficients are the estimated change from the baseline. 

```{r}
## calculate predicted values
penguins_nafree$pred_vals <- predict(slm_sp)
## plot
ggplot(data = penguins_nafree, aes(y = bill_depth_mm, x = bill_length_mm, color = species)) +
  geom_point() + ylab("Bill depth (mm)") +
  xlab("Bill length (mm)") + theme_classic()  +
  geom_line(aes(y = pred_vals))

```



### Interactions

Recall the (*additive*) model formula from above

$$Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1z_i + \beta_2x_i + \epsilon_i$$


  
**but**  what about interactions between variables? For example, 

$$Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1z_i + \beta_2x_i + \beta_3z_ix_i + \epsilon_i$$

**Note:** to include interaction effects in our model by using either the `*` or `:` syntax in our model formula. For example,

 + `:` denotes the interaction of the variables to its left and right, and

 + `*` means to include all main effects and interactions, so `a*b` is the same as `a + b + a:b`.

See [Model formula syntax](Model formula syntax) for further details.

To specify a model with additive and interaction effects we use

```{r}
slm_int <- lm(bill_depth_mm ~ bill_length_mm*species, data = penguins_nafree)

```


**Model formula**

The model formula is then

```{r, echo = FALSE, results='asis'}
extract_eq(slm_int, wrap = TRUE)
```

**Fitted model**

```{r}
summary(slm_int)$coef
```

As before the `(Intercept)`: `Estimate` gives us the estimated average bill depth (mm) of the **Adelie** penguins **given the other variables in the model**.

The `bill_length_mm` : `Estimate` ($\beta_1$ above) is the slope associated with bill length (mm). So, here for every 1mm increase in bill length we estimated a `r round(summary(slm_int)$coef[2,1],3)`mm increase in bill depth.

The main effects of species (i.e., `speciesChinstrap`: `Estimate` and `speciesGentoo`:`Estimate` ) again give the shift (up or down) of the lines from the **Adelie** level; however these lines are no longer parallel! The interaction terms (i.e., `bill_length_mm:speciesChinstrap` and `bill_length_mm:speciesGentoo`) specify the species specific slopes **given the other variables in the model**.


Look at the plot below. Now we've specified this *all singing and dancing* interaction model we might ask **are the non-parallel lines non-parallel enough to reject the parallel line model**?

```{r}
## calculate predicted values
penguins_nafree$pred_vals <- predict(slm_int)
## plot
ggplot(data = penguins_nafree, aes(y = bill_depth_mm, x = bill_length_mm, color = species)) +
  geom_point() + ylab("Bill depth (mm)") +
  xlab("Bill length (mm)") + theme_classic()  +
  geom_line(aes(y = pred_vals))

```
