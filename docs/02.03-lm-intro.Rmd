## Linear regression

### Model formula syntax in `R`

In `R` to specify the model you want to fit you typically create a model formula object; this is usually then passed as the first argument to the model fitting function (e.g., `lm()`).

Some notes on syntax:

Consider the model formula example `y ~ x + z + x:z`. There is a lot going on here:

 + The variable to the left of `~` specifies the response, everything to the right specify the explanatory variables
 + `+` indicated to include the variable to the left of it and to the right of it (it does **not** mean they should be summed)
 + `:` denotes the interaction of the variables to its left and right
 
Additional, some other symbols have special meanings in model formula:

 + `*` means to include all main effects and interactions, so `a*b` is the same as `a + b + a:b`
 
 + `^` is used to include main effects and interactions up to a specified level. For example, `(a + b + c)^2` is equivalent to `a + b + c + a:b + a:c + b:c` (note `(a + b + c)^3` would also add `a:b:c`)
 + `-` excludes terms that might otherwise be included. For example, `-1` excludes the intercept otherwise included by default, and `a*b - b` would produce `a + a:b`
 
Mathematical functions can also be directly used in the model formula to transform a variable directly (e.g., `y ~ exp(x) + log(z) + x:z`). One thing that may seem counter intuitive is in creating polynomial expressions (e.g., x2). Here the expression `y ~ x^2` does **not** relate to squaring the explanatory variable x (this is to do with the syntax `^` you see above. To include x^2 as a term in our model we have to use the `I()` (the "as-is" operator). For example, `y ~ I(x^2) `).



| Traditional name    | Model formula  | R code  |
| ------------------- |:--------------:| -------:|
| Simple regression   | $Y \sim X_{continuous}$ | `lm(Y ~ X)` |
| One-way ANOVA       | $Y \sim X_{categorical}$      |   `lm(Y ~ X)` |
| Two-way ANOVA       | $Y \sim X1_{categorical} + X2_{categorical}$| `lm(Y ~ X1 + X2)` |
| ANCOVA              | $Y \sim X1_{continuous} + X2_{categorical}$ |`lm(Y ~ X1 + X2)` |
| Multiple regression | $Y \sim X1_{continuous} + X2_{continuous}$ | `lm(Y ~ X1 + X2)` |
| Factorial ANOVA     | $Y \sim X1_{categorical} * X2_{categorical}$|   `lm(Y ~ X1 * X2)` or `lm(Y ~ X1 + X2 + X1:X2)` |

### Some mathematical notation

Let's consider a linear regression with a simple explanatory variable:

$$Y_i = \alpha + \beta_1x_i + \epsilon_i$$
where

$$\epsilon_i \sim \text{Normal}(0,\sigma^2).$$

Here for observation $i$

  + $Y_i$ is the value of the response 
  + $x_i$ is the value of the explanatory variable 
  + $\epsilon_i$ is the error term: the difference between $Y_i$ and its expected value
  + $\alpha$ is the intercept term (a parameter to be estimated), and 
  + $\beta_1$ is the slope: coefficient of the explanatory variable (a parameter to be estimated)

When we fit a linear model we make some **key assumptions**:

+ **Independence** 
+ There is a **linear relationship** between the response and the explanatory variables
+ The residuals have **constant variance**
+ The **residuals** are normally distributed

In [Module 4] you will learn that we have tools that enable us to relax some of these assumptions, after all these assumptions only very rarely hold for real-world data.

In the sections below we use the `penguins` data from the `palmerpenguins` package to fit a number of different models using bill Depth (mm) of penguins as the response variable. We first remove the NA values for the response variable:

```{r}
penguins <- filter(penguins, !is.na(penguins$bill_depth_mm))
```

### A Null model


```{r, message=FALSE}
ggplot(data = penguins, aes(x = bill_depth_mm)) +
  geom_histogram() + theme_classic() +
  xlab("Bill depth (mm)")

```


**Let's fit a null (intercept only)  model.** This in *old money* would be called a one sample t-test. 

```{r null}
slm_null <- lm(bill_depth_mm ~ 1, data = penguins)
summary(slm_null)$coef
```

**Model formula**

This model, from above, is simply $$Y_i = \alpha + \epsilon_i.$$ 

Here for observation $i$ $Y_i$ is the value of the response (`bill_depth_mm`) and $\alpha$ is a parameter to be estimated (typically called the intercept).


**Inference**

The `(Intercept)` term, `r summary(slm_null)$coef[1,1]`, tells us the (estimated) average value of the response (`bill_depth_mm`), see

```{r av}
penguins %>% summarise(average_bill_depth = mean(bill_depth_mm))
```

The SEM (`Std. Error`) = `r summary(slm_null)$coef[1,2]`. 

The hypothesis being tested is $H_0:$ (`(Intercept)` ) $\text{mean}_{\text{`average_bill_depth`}} = 0$ vs. $H_1:$ (`(Intercept)`) $\text{mean}_{\text{`average_bill_depth`}} \neq 0$ 

The t-statistic is given by `t value` = `Estimate` / `Std. Error` =  `r summary(slm_null)$coef[1,3]`

The p-value is given by`Pr (>|t|)` =  `r summary(slm_null)$coef[1,4]`.

So the probability of observing a t-statistic as least as extreme given under the null hypothesis (average bill depth = 0) given our data is `r summary(slm_null)$coef[1,4]`, pretty strong evidence against the null hypothesis I'd say!
	

### Single continuous variable

**Does `bill_length_mm` help explain some of the variation in `bill_depth_mm`?**

```{r}
p1 <- ggplot(data = penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = bill_depth_mm)) +
  geom_point() + ylab("Bill depth (mm)") +
  xlab("Bill length (mm)") + theme_classic()
p1
```

```{r slm}
slm <- lm(bill_depth_mm ~ bill_length_mm, data = penguins)
```



**Model formula**

This model is simply $$Y_i = \alpha + \beta_1x_i + \epsilon_i$$ where for observation $i$ $Y_i$ is the value of the response (`bill_depth_mm`) and $x_i$ is the value of the explanatory variable (`bill_length_mm`); As above $\alpha$ and $\beta_1$ are parameters to be estimated. We could also write this model as
  
  
```{r, echo = FALSE, results='asis'}
library(equatiomatic)
extract_eq(slm, wrap = TRUE)
```

**Fitted model**

As before we extract the estimated parameters (here $\alpha$ and $\beta_1$) using

```{r}
summary(slm)$coef
```

Here, the `(Intercept)`: `Estimate` ($\alpha$ above) gives us the estimated average bill depth (mm) **given the estimated relationship** bill length (mm) and bill length.

The `bill_length_mm` : `Estimate` ($\beta_1$ above) is the slope associated with bill length (mm). So, here for every 1mm increase in bill length we estimated a `r -1*round(summary(slm)$coef[2,1],3)`mm decrease (or a `r round(summary(slm)$coef[2,1],3)`mm increase) in bill depth.

```{r}
## calculate predicted values
penguins$pred_vals <- predict(slm)
## plot
ggplot(data = penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = bill_depth_mm)) +
  geom_point() + ylab("Bill depth (mm)") +
  xlab("Bill length (mm)") + theme_classic() +
  geom_line(aes(y = pred_vals))

```

### A single factor variable

**Does `bill_depth_mm` vary between species?** Think of ANOVA.

```{r}
p1 <- ggplot(data = penguins, aes(x = species, y = bill_depth_mm)) +
  geom_violin() + ylab("Bill depth (mm)") +
  xlab("Species") + theme_classic() + stat_summary(stat = "mean")
p1
```

```{r sflm}
sflm <- lm(bill_depth_mm ~ species, data = penguins)
```

**Model formula**

This model is simply $$Y_i = \alpha + \beta_1x_i + \epsilon_i$$ where for observation $i$, $Y_i$ is the value of the response (`bill_depth_mm`) and $x_i$ is the value of the explanatory variable (`species`). However, `species` is a factor variable. This means we need to use dummy variables: 
  
  
```{r, echo = FALSE, results='asis'}
library(equatiomatic)
extract_eq(sflm, wrap = TRUE)
```

**Fitted model**

The estimated parameters (here $\alpha$, $\beta_1$, and $\beta_2$) are

```{r}
summary(sflm)$coef
```

Here, the `(Intercept)`: `Estimate` ($\alpha$ above) gives us the estimated average bill depth (mm) of the baseline species **Adelie** (`R` does this alphabetically, to change this see previous chapter) and the remaining coefficients are the estimated difference between the baseline and the other categories (`species`). The `Std. Error` column gives the standard error for these estimated parameters (in the case of the group differences there are the SEDs, standard error of the difference).


```{r}
## calculate predicted values
penguins$pred_vals <- predict(sflm)
## plot
ggplot(data = penguins, aes(x = species, y = bill_depth_mm, fill = species)) +
  geom_violin() + ylab("Bill depth (mm)") +
  xlab("Species") + theme_classic() +
  geom_hline(aes(yintercept = pred_vals, col = species), linewidth = 2) +
	stat_summary(stat = "mean")

```


### One factor and a continuous variable


```{r}
p2 <- ggplot(data = penguins,
             aes(y = bill_depth_mm, x = bill_length_mm, color = species)) +
  geom_point() + ylab("Bill depth (mm)") +
  xlab("Bill length (mm)") + theme_classic()
p2
```

```{r}
slm_sp <- lm(bill_depth_mm ~ bill_length_mm + species, data = penguins)
```


**Model formula**

Now we have two explanatory variables, so our model formula becomes

$$Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1z_i + \beta_2x_i + \epsilon_i$$
$$\epsilon_i \sim \text{Normal}(0,\sigma^2)$$

where for observation $i$

  + $Y_i$ is the value of the response (`bill_depth_mm`)
  + $z_i$ is one explanatory variable (`bill_length_mm` say)
  + $x_i$ is another explanatory variable (`species` say)
  + $\epsilon_i$ is the error term: the difference between $Y_i$ and its expected value
  + $\alpha$, $\beta_1$, and $\beta_2$ are all parameters to be estimated.
  

Here, again, the **Adelie** group are the baseline.

So model formula is

```{r, echo = FALSE, results='asis'}
extract_eq(slm_sp, wrap = TRUE)
```

**Fitted model**


```{r}
summary(slm_sp)$coef
```


**Simpson's paradox...** look how the slope associated with bill length (coefficient of `bill_length_mm`) has switched direction from the model above! Why do you think this is?


Here, the `(Intercept)`: `Estimate` gives us the estimated average bill depth (mm) of the **Adelie** penguins **given the estimated relationship** between bill length and bill depth. Technically, this is the estimated bill depth (mm) for Adelie penguins with zero bill length. That is clearly a nonsense way to interpret this as that would be an impossible situation in practice! I would recommend as thinking of this as the y-shift (i.e., height) of the fitted line.

The `bill_length_mm` : `Estimate` ($\beta_1$ above) is the slope associated with bill length (mm). So, here for every 1mm increase in bill length we estimated a `r round(summary(slm_sp)$coef[2,1],3)`mm increase in bill depth.

What about the coefficient of the other species levels? Look at the plot below, these values give the shift (up or down) of the **parallel** lines from the **Adelie** level. So given the estimated relationship between bill depth and bill length these coefficients are the estimated change from the baseline. 

```{r}
## calculate predicted values
penguins$pred_vals <- predict(slm_sp)
## plot
ggplot(data = penguins, aes(y = bill_depth_mm, x = bill_length_mm, color = species)) +
  geom_point() + ylab("Bill depth (mm)") +
  xlab("Bill length (mm)") + theme_classic()  +
  geom_line(aes(y = pred_vals))

```



### Interactions

Recall the (*additive*) model formula from above

$$Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1z_i + \beta_2x_i + \epsilon_i$$


  
**but**  what about interactions between variables? For example, 

$$Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1z_i + \beta_2x_i + \beta_3z_ix_i + \epsilon_i$$

**Note:** to include interaction effects in our model by using either the `*` or `:` syntax in our model formula. For example,

 + `:` denotes the interaction of the variables to its left and right, and

 + `*` means to include all main effects and interactions, so `a*b` is the same as `a + b + a:b`.


To specify a model with additive and interaction effects we use

```{r}
slm_int <- lm(bill_depth_mm ~ bill_length_mm*species, data = penguins)

```


**Model formula**

The model formula is then

```{r, echo = FALSE, results='asis'}
extract_eq(slm_int, wrap = TRUE)
```

**Fitted model**

```{r}
summary(slm_int)$coef
```

This can be written out:

```{r, echo = FALSE, results='asis'}
extract_eq(slm_int, wrap = TRUE, use_coefs = TRUE)
```

The interaction terms (i.e., `bill_length_mm:speciesChinstrap` and `bill_length_mm:speciesGentoo`) specify the species specific slopes **given the other variables in the model**. We can use our dummy variable trick again to interpret the coefficients correctly. In this instance we have one factor explanatory variable, Species, and one continuous explanatory variable, bill length (mm). As before, Adelie is our baseline reference. 

Let's assume we're talking about the **Adelie** penguins, then our equation becomes (using the dummy variable technique) 

$$\widehat{\text{bill_depth_mm}} = `r round(coef(slm_int)[1], 3)` + (`r round(coef(slm_int)[2], 3)` \times \text{bill_length_mm}).$$

So, the `(Intercept): Estimate` term ($\hat{\alpha}$), again, specifies the height of the Adelie fitted line and the main effect of `bill_length_mm: Estimate` ($\hat{\beta_1}$) estimates the relationship (slope) between bill length (mm) and bill depth (mm) for the Adelie penguin. So, here for every 1mm increase in bill length (mm) for the Adelie penguins we estimate, on average, a `r round(coef(slm_int)[2],3)`mm increase in bill depth (mm).

Now, what about **Gentoo** penguins? Our equation then becomes

$$\widehat{\text{bill_depth_mm}} = `r round(coef(slm_int)[1], 3)` + (`r round(coef(slm_int)[2], 3)` \times \text{bill_length_mm}) + (`r round(coef(slm_int)[4], 3)`) + (`r round(coef(slm_int)[6], 3)` \times \text{bill_length_mm}).$$

which simplifies to

$$\widehat{\text{bill_depth_mm}} = `r round(coef(slm_int)[1] + coef(slm_int)[4], 3)` + (`r round(coef(slm_int)[2] + coef(slm_int)[6], 3)` \times \text{bill_length_mm}).$$

The estimated Gentoo-specific intercept term (y-axis line height) is therefore $\hat{\alpha} + \hat{\beta_3} = `r round(coef(slm_int)[1], 3)` + (`r round(coef(slm_int)[4], 3)`) = `r round(coef(slm_int)[1] + coef(slm_int)[4], 3)`.$ The Gentoo-specific bill length (mm) slope is then $\hat{\beta_1} + \hat{\beta_5} = `r round(coef(slm_int)[2], 3)` + `r round(coef(slm_int)[6], 3)` = `r round(coef(slm_int)[2] + coef(slm_int)[6], 3)`.$ So, for every 1mm increase in bill length (mm) for the Gentoo penguins we estimate, on average, a `r round(coef(slm_int)[2] + coef(slm_int)[6], 3)`mm increase in bill depth (mm), a slightly steeper slope than for the estimated Adelie relationship (i.e., we estimate that as Gentoo bills get longer their depth increases at a, slightly, greater rate than those of Adelie penguins).

In summary, the main effect of species (i.e., `speciesChinstrap`: `Estimate` and `speciesGentoo`:`Estimate` ) again give the shift (up or down) of the lines from the **Adelie** level. However, these lines are no longer parallel (i.e., each species of penguin has a different estimated relationship between bill length and bill depth)! 



But, now we've specified this *all singing and dancing* interaction model we might ask **are the non-parallel lines non-parallel enough to reject the parallel line model**? Look at the plot below; what do you think?

```{r, echo = FALSE}
## calculate predicted values
penguins$pred_vals <- predict(slm_int)
## plot
ggplot(data = penguins, aes(y = bill_depth_mm, x = bill_length_mm, color = species)) +
  geom_point() + ylab("Bill depth (mm)") +
  xlab("Bill length (mm)") + theme_classic()  +
  geom_line(aes(y = pred_vals))

```

<strong>Other possible relationships</strong>

Let's assume that we have the same data types as above, specifically, a continuous response ($y$) and one factor ($f$, with two levels $A$ and $B$) and one continuous ($x$) explanatory variable. Assuming that $A$ is the baseline for $f$ the possible models are depicted below.

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.height = 6, fig.width = 10}

Note that models III and V are forced to have the same intercept for both levels of $f$. In addition, when you have no main effect of $x$, models IV and V, then the model is forced to have no effect of $x$ for the baseline level of $f$ (in this case $A$).
