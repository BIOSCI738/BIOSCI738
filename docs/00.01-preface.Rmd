# Key Information {-}

<span><strong>**Please read this page carefully as it contains important information about the course structure, delivery, and assessment.**</span></strong>
</div>

### Overview {-}

This is a postgraduate course geared towards students of biology, ecology, and environmental science. Building on a strong foundation in quantitative biology, fundamental statistical methods and basic R programming, you will learn an array of advanced biostatistical methods for data analysis. Topics covered include data wrangling, methods for the analysis of designed experiments, regression analysis, including mixed effect models, and the analysis of multivariate data, including advanced supervised and unsupervised learning techniques. 

### Prerequisites {-}

The course builds on assumed knowledge of some fundamental statistical concepts. It is expected that you are comfortable with the statistical content covered in a typical undergraduate (bio)statistics course (e.g., linear regression, hypothesis testing etc.). In addition, we will use the programming language `R` (through RStudio) and you are expected to be familiar with data import, manipulation, and visualization. If you are unfamiliar with `R` it is expected that you will prepare accordingly before the semester begins. I recommend that you recap the content of [BIOSCI220](https://biosci220.github.io/BIOSCI220/).

<div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert">

<span><strong>Before the course begins you are required to complete the [pre-course tasks](https://canvas.auckland.ac.nz/courses/103658/modules).</span></strong>


</div>

These [tasks]((https://canvas.auckland.ac.nz/courses/103658/modules)) are designed for you to self-assess your `R` and statistics knowledge. If you fail to complete the coding task and score less than 70% on the quiz you will likely struggle with the pace and content of the course. This does not preclude you from taking the course, however, you should expect to invest time on top of what is expected for a postgraduate course into ensuring that you understand the material.

### Lectures {-}

<div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert">

<span><strong>Lectures are weekly</span></strong> (weeks 2–12)

### Course policies {-}


**Accessibility:** If there is any portion of the course that is not accessible to you due to challenges with technology or the course format, please let me know so we can make appropriate accommodations.


#### Academic honesty {-}

<div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert">

<span><strong>TL;DR: Don’t cheat!</span></strong>

</div>

Please abide by the following as you work on assignments in this course:

 + You may **discuss** individual homework and lab assignments with other students; however, you may not directly share (or copy) code or write up with other students. For team assignments, you may collaborate freely within your team. You may discuss the assignment with other teams; however, you may not directly share (or copy) code or write up with another team. Unauthorized sharing (or copying) of the code or write up will be considered a violation for all students involved.
 + **Reusing code** Unless explicitly stated otherwise, you may make use of online resources (e.g., StackOverflow) for coding examples on assignments. If you directly use code from an outside source (or use it as inspiration), you must explicitly cite where you obtained the code. Any recycled code that is discovered and is not explicitly cited will be treated as plagiarism.
 

#### Late work & extensions {-}

The due dates for assignments are there to help you keep up with the course material and to ensure the teaching team can provide feedback within a timely manner. However, I understand that things come up periodically that could make it difficult to submit an assignment by the deadline. If this is the case for you it is imperative that you get in contact with me **as soon as possible** so that we might make alternative arrangements.
