## Intro to `R` & `RStudio`

**R is the pheromone to RStudio's PDA**

![](img/r-rstudio-pda.jpg)

`R` is the pheromone to `RStudio`'s PDA.


`R` is a language, specifically, a programming language; it's the way you can speak to your computer to ask it to carry out certain computations.

`RStudio` is an integrated development environment (IDE). This means it is basically an interface, albeit a fancy one, that makes it easier to communicate with your computer in the language `R`. The main benefit is the additional features it has that enable you to more efficiently *speak* `R`.

**Note** `R` and `RStudio` are two **different** pieces of software; for this course you are expected to download both. As you'd expect, the PDA depends on the pheromones (i.e., `RStudio` depends on `R`) so you have to download `R` to use `RStudio`! 


### Why?

`R`

+ It's free
+ It's [open source](https://opensource.com/resources/what-open-source)
+ A general-purpose of programming language
+ Written by statisticians (here in Auckland!)
+ It's available for all operating systems (Windows, Linux, and Mac)
+ There is a huge online support network
+ It's extremely flexible; if you can code it you can do it! 15,000+ packages available!
+ ...

`RStudio`

> "If R were an airplane, RStudio would be the airport..." `r tufte::quote_footer('--- Julie Lowndes, Introduction to RStudio Awesomeness')`

 
+ Speaks nicely to `R`
+ Tab completion
+ Debugging capabilities
+ There is a huge online support network
+ Offers many other features and tools to make your workflow with `R` easier
+ It facilitates [reproducibility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproducibility)
+ ...

### Installing R and RStudio

As mentioned above `RStudio` depends on `R` so there is an order you should follow when you download these software.

 1. **Download and install `R`** by following [these instructions](https://cloud.r-project.org/). Make sure you choose the correct operating system.
 
 2. **Download and install `RStudio`** by [going here](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) choosing RStudio Desktop *Open Source License* **Free** and following instructions. 

 3. **Check all is working**
    + Open up `RStudio` from your computer menu, the icon will look something like this ![](https://vectorified.com/images/rstudio-icon-31.png){width=7%} (**DO NOT** use this icon  ![](https://cdn.iconscout.com/icon/free/png-512/r-5-283170.png){width=4%}, this is a link to `R` and will only open a very basic interface)
    + Wait a little and you should see `RStudio` open up to something similar to the screenshot below
    ![](https://stats220.earo.me/img/rstudio-interface.png)
    + Pay close attention to the notes in the screenshot and familiarise yourself with the terms.
    + Finally, in the *Console* next to the prompt type `1:10` and press enter on your keyboard. Your computer should say something back you (in the *Console*)! What do you think you were asking it to do? Does the output make sense?^[You should have seen the numbers 1 to 10 printed out as a sequence.]



## Getting started

As in *step 3.* above  open up `RStudio` from your computer menu, the icon will look something like this ![](https://vectorified.com/images/rstudio-icon-31.png){width=7%}. Using the diagram above identify the different panes:

 + *Console* where you directly type command in and communicate with your computer (via the language `R`).
 + *Environment pane*
 + *Files pane*

Some terminology

+ *Running* code: the act of telling R to perform an act by giving it commands in the console.
+ *Objects*: where values are saved in  (see later for creating an *object*.
+ *Script*: a text file containing a set of commands and comments.
+ *Comments*: notes written within a *Script* to better document/explain what's happening

### R errors  `r emo::ji('scream')`

```{r errors, echo = TRUE, error = TRUE}
data <- read.csv("data_file_not_in_my_working_directory.csv")
library(some_library_I_have_not_installed)
some_function_I_spelled_worng(x = x)
an_object_I_have_not_created
```

**What do you think the issues are here** `r emo::ji("wink")`

### R *Script*s (a `.r` file)

Go **File** > **New File** > **R Script** to open up a new *Script*

If you had only three panes showing before, a new (fourth) pane should open up in the top left of `RStudio`. This file will have a `.r` extension and is where you can write, edit, and save the `R` commands you write. It's a dedicated text editor for your `R` code (very useful if you want to save your code to run at a later date). The main difference between typing your code into a *Script* vs *Console* is that you edit it and save it for later! Remember though the *Console* is the pane where you communicate with your computer so all code you write will have to be *Run* here. There are two ways of *running* a line of code you've written in your *Script*

 + Ensure your cursor is on the line of code you want to run, hold down **Ctrl** and press **Enter**.
 + Ensure your cursor is on the line of code you want to run, then use your mouse to click the Run button (it has a green arrow next to it) on the top right of the *Script* pane.

Type `1:10` in your *Script* and practise *running* this line of code using both methods above. Not that if you've *Run* the code successfully then your computer will speak back to you each time via the *Console*

### Writing *Comments*

*Comments* are notes to yourself (future or present) or to someone else and are, typically, written interspersed in your code. Now, the comments you write will typically be in a language your computer doesn't understand (e.g., English). So that you can write yourself notes in your *Script* you need to tell your computer using the `R` language to ignore them. To do this precede any note you write with \#, see below. The \# is `R` for *ignore anything after this character*.

```{r comments, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE}
## IGNORE ME
## I'm a comment
## I repeat I'm a comment
## I am not a cat
## OK let's run some code
2 + 2
## Hmm maybe I should check this
## @kareem_carr ;-)
```

Now remember when you want to leave your `R` session you'll need to **Save** your *Script* to use it again. To do this go **File** > **Save As** and name your file what you wish (remember too to choose a relevant folder on your computer, or as recommended use the `.Rproj` set-up as above).


### Change the `RStudio` appearance up to your taste

Go to **Tools** > **Global Options** > **Apperance**

![](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/article_attachments/115020425168/Screen_Shot_2017-08-24_at_1.14.19_PM.png)



## Reproducible research

 + Keep all similar files for the same analysis in the same place 

 + **NEVER** change raw data

### Good practice

**Always start with a clean workspace** **Why?** *So your ex (code) can't come and mess up your life!*

![](https://memegenerator.net/img/instances/57296391/when-your-ex-texts-you-after-months-hey-whats-up-not-today-satan-not-today.jpg) 


Go to **Tools** > **Global Options**

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/2784/1*dUNl71Jic2zYhYS2hxOBZA.png)


**Project-oriented workflow**. Recommended: `.Rproj`

+ **Organised** Set up each Each assignment/university course as a *project*
+ **Self-contained** a *project* is a folder that contains all relevant files
   + All paths can then be relative to that *project*
+ **Reproducible** the *project* should just work on a different computer

Got to **Project** (top right) > **New Project** > **Create Project** ![](https://stats220.earo.me/img/rstudio-proj.png)

**Project set-up**

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/martinctc/blog/master/images/RPROJECT_2000dpi.png){width=30%}


**`r emo::ji("warning")`Warning`r emo::ji("warning")`**

[Jenny Bryan will set your computer on fire](https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2017/12/workflow-vs-script/) `r emo::ji("fire")` if you start your script like this

```{r fire, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
rm(list = ls())
```

This

+ does **NOT** create a fresh `R` process
+ it makes your script vulnerable
+ it **will** come back to bite you





## Version control with `git` and GitHub
**All workshops will use these tools**

![](https://images3.memedroid.com/images/UPLOADED29/5b7d571106c71.jpeg){scale=50%}

`git` the software


> "Track Changes features from Microsoft Word on steroids"`r tufte::quote_footer('--- Jenny Bryan ')`

  + a version control system
  + manages the evolution of a set of files (tidily)

**GitHub** an online hosting service



> "Think of it as DropBox but much, much better"`r tufte::quote_footer('--- Jenny Bryan ')`

  +  home for your Git-based projects on the internet
  

### Setup TL;DR

+ Register an account with GitHub [https://github.com](https://github.com)
+ Make sure you've got the latest version of `R`
```{r version}
R.version.string
```
+ Upgrade `RStudio` to the [new preview version](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/preview/) (*optional*)
+ Install git: follow [these instructions](https://happygitwithr.com/install-git.html)
+ [Get started](https://happygitwithr.com/hello-git.html)



## Exploratory Data Analysis

or EDA we will be using `tidyverse`. ['tidyverse'](https://www.tidyverse.org/) is a collection of `R` packages that all share underlying design philosophy, grammar, and data structures. They are specifically designed to make data wrangling, manipulation, visualisation, and analysis simpler.


### Starting out with `tidyverse`


<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/allisonhorst/stats-illustrations/master/rstats-artwork/tidyverse_celestial.png" width="40%">

Artwork by [@allison_horst](https://github.com/allisonhorst/)

 Starting out with `tidyverse`


To install **all** the packages that belong to the `tidyverse` run

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
## request (download) the tidyverse packages from the centralised library
install.packages("tidyverse")

```

To tell your computer to access the `tidyverse` functionality in your session run `r library(tidyverse)` (**Note** you'll have to do this each time you start up an `R` session):

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE}
## Get the tidyverse packages from our local library
library(tidyverse)

```

### Reading in data from a `.csv` file

First off download the `paua.csv` file from CANVAS 

To read the data into `RStudio` 

 1. In the *Environment* pane click **Import Dataset** >  ** From Text (readr)** > **Browse** > *Choose your file, remembering which folder you downloaded it to. this is where `.Rproj` is useful* > *Another pane should pop up, check the data looks as you might expect* > **Import**
 
 
```{r read quiet, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE, message = FALSE}
paua <- read_csv("../../BIOSCI220/data/paua.csv")
```

2. Or

```{r read demo, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE, message = FALSE}
paua <- read_csv("paua.csv")
```


### Explore your data

Let's have a look at your data in the *Console*

```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = TRUE}
paua
```


###Explore your data

Using the `glimpse()` command for an alternative view

```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = TRUE}
glimpse(paua)
```

### The pipe operator `%>%`

A nifty `tidyverse` tool is called the pipe operator `%>%`. The pipe operator allows us to combine multiple operations in `R` into a single sequential chain of actions.

Say you would like to perform a hypothetical sequence of operations on a hypothetical data frame x using hypothetical functions f(), g(), and h():

+ Take `x` then
+ Use `x` as an input to a function `f()` then
+ Use the output of this as an input to a function `g()` then
+ Use the output of this as an input to a function `h()`


So to calculate the mean **Age** of each **Species** in the `paua` dataset we would use

```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = TRUE}
paua %>%
group_by(Species) %>%
summarize(mean_age = mean(Age))
```

You would read the sequence  above as:

+ Take the `paua` data.frame then
+ Use this and apply the `group_by()` function to group by `Species`
+ Use this output and apply the `summarize()` function to calculate the mean Age of each group (Species), calling the resulting number `mean_age`


Or to describe my daily routine...

```{r echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
I %>%
  wake_up(time = "later than I should") %>%
  give(who = "Watson" , what = "medication") %>%
  make(who= "myself", what = "coffee") %>%
  drink() %>%
  try(remember_what_I_have_on(date = "today"))

```

**Have a go at writing your own!**
