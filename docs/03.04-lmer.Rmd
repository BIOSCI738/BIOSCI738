## Linear mixed-effect models (LMMs)

**Fixed effects:** terms (parameters) in a statistical model which are fixed, or non-random, quantities (e.g., *treatment* group's mean response). For the same *treatment*, we expect this quantity to be the same from experiment to experiment.
**Random effects:** terms (parameters) in a statistical model which are considered as random quantities or variables (e.g., block id). Specifically, terms whose levels are a representative sample from a population, and where the variance of the population is of interest should be allocated as random. Setting a block as a random effect allows us to infer variation between blocks as well as the variation between experimental units within blocks.
