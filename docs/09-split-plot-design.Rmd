# Split-plot and repeated measures designs

## Learning objectives

   + **Describe** and **discuss** split-plot experimental design
   + **Describe** and **discuss** repeated measures experiments
   + **Write** `R` code to **visualise** repeated measures data 
   + **Carry** out appropriate analysis in `R` and **draw** the appropriate inference


## Analysis of a split-plot design

**Recall the diabetic and healthy male Wistar rats...**

**BUT** what about

![](img/split-plot.png)
**Data available on CANVAS**

```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
split_plot <- read_csv("../data/split_plot.csv")
```


```{r, eval = FALSE}
split_plot <- read_csv("split_plot.csv")
```

```{r}
## recall we need to set factors
split_plot$Animal <- factor(split_plot$Animal)
split_plot$Sample <- factor(split_plot$Sample)
split_plot
```

### Using `aov()`

```{r}
sp_aov <- aov(logAUC ~ Disease*Organ + Error(Animal/Sample), data = split_plot)
summary(sp_aov)
```

### Using `lmer()` (from `lmeTest` and `lmer4`) and `predictmeans()`

```{r}
library(lmerTest) ## MUST LOAD THIS
sp_lmer <- lmerTest::lmer(logAUC ~ Disease*Organ + (1|Animal), data = split_plot) ## MUST SPECIFY WHICH PACKAGE
anova(sp_lmer,type = 2)
```

```{r}
library(lme4)
library(predictmeans)
sp_lmer4 <- lme4::lmer(logAUC ~ Disease*Organ + (1|Animal), data = split_plot) ## MUST SPECIFY WHICH PACKAGE
sp_predmeans <- predictmeans(sp_lmer4,modelterm = "Disease:Organ", pairwise = TRUE, plot = FALSE)
sp_predmeans
```


## Analysis of a repeated measures design

We have (*balanced*) data with the same number of observations on each rat at the same time points.

### The data

**Data available on CANVAS**

```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
liver <- read_csv("../data/repeated_measures_liver.csv")
```


```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
liver <- read_csv("repeated_measures_liver.csv")
```

```{r}
## change time to factor
liver$Time <- as.factor(liver$Time)
glimpse(liver)
```


### Visualise

**plot data**

```{r}
ggplot(liver, aes(x = Time, y = Glucose, color = Treatment, group = Animal)) +
  geom_line(size = 1) + 
  geom_point(shape = 1) +
  theme_bw()
```

**plot group means**

```{r}
liver_means <- liver %>% group_by(Time,Treatment) %>%
  summarise(Glucose = mean(Glucose))
ggplot(liver_means, aes(x = Time, y = Glucose, color = Treatment, group = Treatment)) +
  geom_line(size = 1) + 
  geom_point(shape = 1) +
  theme_bw()
```

**linear?**

```{r}
ggplot(liver_means, aes(x = Time, y = Glucose, color = Treatment, group = Treatment)) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) +
  geom_point(shape = 1) +
  theme_bw()
```

### Using `aov()`

```{r}
re_aov <- aov(Glucose ~ Treatment*Time + Error(Animal),data = liver)
summary(re_aov)
```

### Using `lmer()` (from `lmerTest` and `lme4`) and `predictmeans()`

```{r}
library(lmerTest) ## MUST LOAD THIS
re_lmer <- lmerTest::lmer(Glucose ~ Treatment*Time + (1|Animal),data = liver) ## MUST SPECIFY WHICH PACKAGE
anova(re_lmer,type = 2)
```

```{r}
library(lme4)
library(predictmeans)
re_lmer4 <- lme4::lmer(Glucose ~ Treatment*Time + (1|Animal),data = liver) ## MUST SPECIFY WHICH PACKAGE
predictmeans::residplot(re_lmer4)
sp_predmeans <- predictmeans(re_lmer4,modelterm = "Time", pairwise = TRUE)
sp_predmeans
```


## Repeated measures designs as *split-plots in time*

In this set of *balanced* data we have
 + Same number of observations on each rat
 + At the same time points


We could analyse as a split-plot design, where
 + *plots* = different rats
 + *subplots* = different times within a rat

Here we would have **two** error components
 + Between rats
 + Between times within rats

There are, however, two big differences between Repeated Measures and Split-plot Designs
  1. Cannot randomise the levels of time
    + Measurement 2 hours, comes after that at 1 hour
  2. Split plot design block structure
    + Imposes the same correlation on any two subplots in the the same plot
       + Implausible for repeated measures designs as observations further apart in time likely to be less
correlated than observations close together
