**With thanks to Prof. Chris Triggs, Dr Kathy Ruggiero, and Prof. James Russell who all freely gave me their previous iterations of the course and told me to do what I wanted with their notes. I did, and they may well find sections of this material hauntingly familiar! Credit also to all the other fantastic people who've shared materials or have made notes freely available online.  I have endeavored to reference all materials, and more, where appropriate.**
