## `R` and `RStudio`

Alternatively, `R` is the pheromone to `RStudio`'s PDA.

`R` is a language, specifically, a programming language; it's the way you can speak to your computer to ask it to carry out certain computations.

`RStudio` is an integrated development environment (IDE). This means it is basically an interface, albeit a fancy one, that makes it easier to communicate with your computer in the language `R`. The main benefit is the additional features it has that enable you to more efficiently *speak* `R`.

**Note** `R` and `RStudio` are two **different** pieces of software; for this course you are expected to download both. As you'd expect, the PDA depends on the pheromones (i.e., `RStudio` depends on `R`) so you have to download `R` to use `RStudio`! 

**Why use** `R`

+ It's free
+ It's [open source](https://opensource.com/resources/what-open-source)
+ A general-purpose of programming language
+ Written by statisticians (here in Auckland!)
+ It's available for all operating systems (Windows, Linux, and Mac)
+ There is a huge online support network
+ It's extremely flexible; if you can code it you can do it! 15,000+ packages available!
+ ...

**Why use** `RStudio`

+ It speaks nicely to `R`
+ Tab completion
+ Debugging capabilities
+ There is a huge online support network
+ Offers many other features and tools to make your workflow with `R` easier
+ It facilitates [reproducibility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproducibility)

### Installing R and RStudio

As mentioned above `RStudio` depends on `R` so there is an order you should follow when you download these software.

 1. **Download and install `R`** by following [these instructions](https://cloud.r-project.org/). Make sure you choose the correct operating system.
 
 2. **Download and install `RStudio`** by [going here](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) choosing RStudio Desktop *Open Source License* **Free** and following instructions. 

 3. **Check all is working**
    + Open up `RStudio` from your computer menu, the icon will look something like this ![](https://vectorified.com/images/rstudio-icon-31.png){width=7%} (**DO NOT** use this icon  ![](https://cdn.iconscout.com/icon/free/png-512/r-5-283170.png){width=4%}, this is a link to `R` and will only open a very basic interface)
    + Wait a little and you should see `RStudio` open up to something similar to the screenshot below
    ![](https://stats220.earo.me/img/rstudio-interface.png)
    + Pay close attention to the notes in the screenshot and familiarise yourself with the terms.
    + Finally, in the *Console* next to the prompt type `1:10` and press enter on your keyboard. Your computer should say something back you (in the *Console*)! What do you think you were asking it to do? Does the output make sense?^[You should have seen the numbers 1 to 10 printed out as a sequence.]



### Getting started

As in *step 3.* above  open up `RStudio` from your computer menu, the icon will look something like this ![](https://vectorified.com/images/rstudio-icon-31.png){width=7%}. Using the diagram above identify the different panes:

 + *Console* where you directly type command in and communicate with your computer (via the language `R`).
 + *Environment pane*
 + *Files pane*

Some terminology

+ *Running* code: the act of telling R to perform an act by giving it commands in the console.
+ *Objects*: where values are saved in  (see later for creating an *object*.
+ *Script*: a text file containing a set of commands and comments.
+ *Comments*: notes written within a *Script* to better document/explain what's happening

#### R errors  `r emo::ji('scream')`

```{r errors, echo = TRUE, error = TRUE}
data <- read.csv("data_file_not_in_my_working_directory.csv")
library(some_library_I_have_not_installed)
some_function_I_spelled_worng(x = x)
an_object_I_have_not_created
```

**What do you think the issues are here** `r emo::ji("wink")`

#### R *Script*s (a `.r` file)

Go **File** > **New File** > **R Script** to open up a new *Script*

If you had only three panes showing before, a new (fourth) pane should open up in the top left of `RStudio`. This file will have a `.r` extension and is where you can write, edit, and save the `R` commands you write. It's a dedicated text editor for your `R` code (very useful if you want to save your code to run at a later date). The main difference between typing your code into a *Script* vs *Console* is that you edit it and save it for later! Remember though the *Console* is the pane where you communicate with your computer so all code you write will have to be *Run* here. There are two ways of *running* a line of code you've written in your *Script*

 1. Ensure your cursor is on the line of code you want to run, hold down **Ctrl** and press **Enter**.
 2. Ensure your cursor is on the line of code you want to run, then use your mouse to click the Run button (it has a green arrow next to it) on the top right of the *Script* pane.

Type `1:10` in your *Script* and practice *running* this line of code using both methods above. Note that if you've *Run* the code successfully then your computer will speak back to you each time via the *Console*

#### Writing *Comments*

*Comments* are notes to yourself (future or present) or to someone else and are, typically, written interspersed in your code. Now, the comments you write will typically be in a language your computer doesn't understand (e.g., English). So that you can write yourself notes in your *Script* you need to tell your computer using the `R` language to ignore them. To do this precede any note you write with \#, see below. The \# is `R` for *ignore anything after this character*.

```{r comments, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE}
## IGNORE ME
## I'm a comment
## I repeat I'm a comment
## I am not a cat
## OK let's run some code
2 + 2
## Hmm maybe I should check this
## @kareem_carr ;-)
```

Now remember when you want to leave your `R` session you'll need to **Save** your *Script* to use it again. To do this go **File** > **Save As** and name your file what you wish (remember too to choose a relevant folder on your computer, or as recommended use the `.Rproj` set-up as above).


#### Change `RStudio`'s appearance 

Go to **Tools** > **Global Options** > **Appearance**
