### Version control with `git` and GitHub

Git is a version control system that manages the evolution of a set of files, called a repository (repo), in a structured way (Think of Word's Track Changes). With Git you can track the changes you make to your project/code. You will **always** have a record of what you've worked on and can easily revert back to an older version if you make a mistake. GitHub is a hosting service that provides a home for your Git-based projects on the internet (think of Dropbox). In addition, GitHub offers functionality to use Git online via an easy-to-use interface. Both Git and GitHub can very easily be configured to work with RStudio.
  
Below are some key terms you will undoubtedly hear when delving into the git--GitHub world.

**Repository** (already mentioned) This where the work happens--think of it as your project folder. It should contain all of your projectâ€™s files etc.

**Cloning** A repository on GitHub is stored remotely in the cloud. To create a local copy of this repository you can clone it and use Git to sync the two.

**Committing** and **pushing** are how you can add the changes you made on your local machine to the remote repository in GitHub. You can make a commit when you have made milestone worthy changes to your project. You should also add a helpful commit message to remind future you, or your teammates, what the changes you made were (e.g., fixed the bug in my_function).

#### Setting up

+ Register an account with GitHub [https://github.com](https://github.com). I would recommend choosing the free option!
+ Make sure you've got the latest version of `R`
```{r version}
R.version.string
```
+ Upgrade `RStudio` to the [new preview version](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/preview/) (*optional*)
+ Install git: follow [these instructions](https://happygitwithr.com/install-git.html)
+ [Get started](https://happygitwithr.com/hello-git.html)

##### Cloning a repository from `GitHub` using `RStudio`

In `GitHub`, navigate to the Code tab of the repository

On the right side of the screen, click `Clone or download`

Click the `Copy to clipboard` icon to the right of the repository URL

Open `RStudio` in your local environment

Click `File`, `New Project`, `Version Control`, `Git`

Paste the repository URL and enter TAB to move to the `Project directory name` field. I've chosen to store this folder on my Desktop, obviously put it wherever you wish :-)

Click `Create Project`. Your *Files* pane should now look similar to this
