# Factorial experiments

![](https://magoosh.com/statistics/files/2018/04/297r7s.jpg)

## Learning objectives

   + **Describe** and **discuss** factorial experiments with both equal and unequal replication
   + **Carry** out linear regression in `R` with two categorical explanatory variables and an interaction (two-way ANOVA with interaction) and **draw** the appropriate inference
   + **Calculate** the marginal means for a balanced and unbalanced design
   
## Factorial design (as a CRD)

**Example**

*Scientific Objective* Global metabolic profiling and comparison of relative abundances of proteins in the inner and outer left ventricle wall of diabetic and healthy male Wistar rats.

### Equal replications (balanced design)

**Analysis** using `lm()`


```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
factorial <- read_csv("../data/factorial_expt.csv")
```


```{r, eval = FALSE}
factorial <- read_csv("factorial_expt.csv")
```

**Fitting models with interaction terms**

```{r}
glimpse(factorial)
## change to factors (saves errors with predictmeans)
factorial$Disease <- as.factor(factorial$Disease)
factorial$Organ <- as.factor(factorial$Organ)
## shorthand version
fac_lm <- lm(logAUC ~ Disease*Organ, data = factorial)
## longhand version
fac_lm_lh <- lm(logAUC ~ Disease + Organ +Disease:Organ, data = factorial)
## both are the SAME
cbind("short hand" = coef(fac_lm),"long hand" = coef(fac_lm_lh))
```

So the full model is

```{r, echo = FALSE, results='asis'}
extract_eq(fac_lm, wrap = TRUE)
```

And the **gobal** null hypotheses being tested are:

+ $H_0: \hat{\mu}_{\text{Diabetic}} = \hat{\mu}_{\text{Healthy}}$
+ $H_0: \hat{\mu}_{\text{innerLV}} = \hat{\mu}_{\text{outerLV}}$
+ $H_0: \hat{\mu}_{\text{Diabetic,innerLV}} = \hat{\mu}_{\text{Diabetic,outerLV}} = \hat{\mu}_{\text{Healthy,innerLV}} = \hat{\mu}_{\text{Healthy,outerLV}}$

```{r}
anova(fac_lm)
```

Plotting the fitted model

```{r, echo = FALSE}
ggplot(data = factorial, aes(x = Disease, y = logAUC, color = Organ)) +
   geom_point() 
```

**Note** with a balanced design ordering of term doesn't matter. For example,

```{r}
fac_lm <- lm(logAUC ~ Disease*Organ, data = factorial)
anova(fac_lm)
fac_lm_2 <- lm(logAUC ~ Organ*Disease, data = factorial)
anova(fac_lm_2)
```

**Inference** using `predictmeans`

```{r}
interaction <- predictmeans(fac_lm, modelterm = "Disease:Organ", pairwise = TRUE)
interaction$`Predicted Means`
interaction$`Standard Error of Means`
interaction$`Pairwise LSDs`
## plot
print(interaction$predictmeansPlot)
```


### Unqual replications (unbalanced design)

As per lecture slides let's set `logAUC` obvservations 1,2,3, 10 to `NA`

```{r}
unbalanced <- factorial
unbalanced$logAUC[c(1:3,10)] <- NA
unbalanced
unbalanced_nafree <- unbalanced %>% drop_na()
unbalanced_nafree
```

```{r}
unbalanced_nafree %>% group_by(Disease, Organ) %>% tally()
```
**Analysis** using `lm()`

**Note**: order matters. For example,

```{r}
fac_lm <- lm(logAUC ~ Disease*Organ, data = unbalanced_nafree)
anova(fac_lm)
fac_lm_2 <- lm(logAUC ~ Organ*Disease, data = unbalanced_nafree)
anova(fac_lm_2)
```


## TL;DR, Model formula syntax in `R`

In `R` to specify the model you want to fit you typically create a model formula object; this is usually then passed as the first argument to the model fitting function (e.g., `lm()`).

Some notes on syntax:

Consider the model formula example `y ~ x + z + x:z`. There is a lot going on here:

 + The variable to the left of `~` specifies the response, everything to the right specify the explanatory variables
 + `+` indicated to include the variable to the left of it and to the right of it (it does **not** mean they should be summed)
 + `:` denotes the interaction of the variables to its left and right
 
Additional, some other symbols have special meanings in model formula:

 + `*` means to include all main effects and interactions, so `a*b` is the same as `a + b + a:b`
 
 + `^` is used to include main effects and interactions up to a specified level. For example, `(a + b + c)^2` is equivalent to `a + b + c + a:b + a:c + b:c` (note `(a + b + c)^3` would also add `a:b:c`)
 + `-` excludes terms that might otherwise be included. For example, `-1` excludes the intercept otherwise included by default, and `a*b - b` would produce `a + a:b`
 
Mathematical functions can also be directly used in the model formula to transform a variable directly (e.g., `y ~ exp(x) + log(z) + x:z`). One thing that may seem counter intuitive is in creating polynomial expressions (e.g., x2). Here the expression `y ~ x^2` does **not** relate to squaring the explanatory variable x (this is to do with the syntax `^` you see above. To include x2 as a term in our model we have to use the `I()` (the "as-is" operator). For example, `y ~ I(x^2) `).
