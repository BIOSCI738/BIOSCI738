['tidyverse'](https://www.tidyverse.org/) is a collection of `R` packages that all share underlying design philosophy, grammar, and data structures. They are specifically designed to make data wrangling, manipulation, visualisation, and analysis simpler.

To install **all** the packages that belong to the `tidyverse` run

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
## request (download) the tidyverse packages from the centralised library
## you only need to do this once per computer :-)
install.packages("tidyverse")

```

To tell your computer to access the `tidyverse` functionality in your session run `r library(tidyverse)` (**Note** you'll have to do this each time you start up an `R` session):

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE}
## Get the tidyverse packages from our local library
library(tidyverse)
## alternatively (does essentially the same thing, 
## but checks if the package is already loaded first)
require(tidyverse)
```

**Note:** If you want to call a function from a specific package then you can use the syntax `package_name::function_name`. Here the `::` specifically tells your computer to use the function `function_name` from the package `package_name`. This is useful if you only want to use a single function from a package (i.e., you don't want to load them all), or want to explicitly tell your computer which package to load the function from if there are multiple functions with the same name. See `readr::read_csv` below for an example of using this syntax. You will also see this in a few places throughout the rest of the notes.

### Reading in data from a `.csv` file

In this section we will be using dataset referring to the age and shell lengths of different P$\overline{\text{a}}$ua. The dataset contains the following variables

 + `Age` of  P$\overline{\text{a}}$ua in years (calculated from counting rings in the cone) 
 + `Length` of  P$\overline{\text{a}}$ua shell in centimeters
 + `Species` of  P$\overline{\text{a}}$ua: *Haliotis iris* (typically found in NZ) and *Haliotis australis* (less commonly found in NZ) 

To read these data into `RStudio` you have two options: 

 1. Download the `paua.csv` file from my [online repository](https://github.com/STATS-UOA/databunker/blob/master/data/paua.csv) into a folder on your local computer. In the *Environment* pane click **Import Dataset** >  ** From Text (readr)** > **Browse** > *Choose your file, remembering which folder you downloaded it to. this is where `.Rproj` is useful* > *Another pane should pop up, check the data looks as you might expect* > **Import**

 2. Or, you can download directly using the URL (or a any other given path)

```{r read demo, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE, message = FALSE}
paua <- readr::read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/STATS-UOA/databunker/master/data/paua.csv")
```



### Explore your data

Let's have a look at your data in the *Console*

```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = TRUE}
paua
```


Use the `glimpse()` command for an alternative view

```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = TRUE}
glimpse(paua)
```

### The pipe operator `%>%`

A nifty `tidyverse` tool is called the pipe operator `%>%`. The pipe operator allows us to combine multiple operations in `R` into a single sequential chain of actions.

Say you would like to perform a hypothetical sequence of operations on a hypothetical data frame x using hypothetical functions f(), g(), and h():

+ Take `x` then
+ Use `x` as an input to a function `f()` then
+ Use the output of this as an input to a function `g()` then
+ Use the output of this as an input to a function `h()`


So to calculate the mean **Age** of each **Species** in the `paua` dataset we would use

```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = TRUE}
paua %>%
  group_by(Species) %>% 
  summarize(mean_age = mean(Age))
```

You would read the sequence  above as:

+ Take the `paua` data.frame then
+ Use this and apply the `group_by()` function to group by `Species`
+ Use this output and apply the `summarize()` function to calculate the mean Age of each group (Species), calling the resulting number `mean_age`


Or to describe my daily routine...

```{r echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
I %>%
  wake_up(time = "later than I should") %>%
  give(who = "Watson" , what = "medication") %>%
  make(who= "myself", what = "coffee") %>%
  drink() %>%
  try(remember_what_I_have_on(date = "today"))

```

## Data wrangling

> "Tidy datasets are all alike, but every messy dataset is messy in its own way." `r tufte::quote_footer('--- Hadley Wickham')`

> "Tidy datasets are easy to manipulate, model and visualize, and have a specific structure: each variable is a column, each observation is a row, and each type of observational unit is a table. This framework makes it easy to tidy messy datasets because only a small set of tools are needed to deal with a wide range of un-tidy datasets." `r tufte::quote_footer('--- Hadley Wickham, Tidy data')`

There are three interrelated rules which make a dataset `tidy`:

 1. Each variable must have its own column
 2. Each observation must have its own row
 3. Each value must have its own cell


Why ensure that your data is `tidy`?  1) **Consistency:** using a consistent format aids learning and reproducibility, and 2) **simplicity:** it's a format that is well understood by `R`!
 
### Introuducing the [Palmer penguins](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0090081)

These data are included in the `R` package `palmerpenguins`; to access the data and follow along with this, and following, sections you should first install the package using 

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
install.packages("palmerpenguins")
```

Then remember to load the package, using `library(palmerpenguins)`, into your workspace each new `R` session in which you wish to use these data.


```{r embed, out.extra='style="border: none;"', out.width='40%', echo = FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_url('https://giphy.com/embed/3og0IO5z8Rd30ktV6g')
```

Let's first have a look at the data:

```{r}
library(palmerpenguins) ## contains some nice penguin data
penguins
```

So, what does this show us?

+ `A tibble: 344 x 8`: A `tibble` is a specific kind of data frame in `R`. The `penguin` dataset has
  + `344` rows (i.e., 344 different observations). Here, each observation corresponds to a penguin.
  + `8` columns corresponding to 3 variables describing each observation.
  + `species`, `island`, `bill_length_mm`, `bill_depth_mm`, `flipper_length_mm`, `body_mass_g`, `sex`, and  `year` are the different variables of this dataset.
  
+ We then have a preview of the first 10 rows of observations corresponding to the first 10 penguins. ```... with 334 more rows` indicates there are 334 more rows to see, but these have not been printed (likely as it would clog our screen)

To learn more about the penguins read the [paper that talks all about the data collection.](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0090081)

### Common dataframe manipulations in the `tidyverse`, using `dplyr` and `tidyr`

Even from these first few rows of data we can see that there are some `NA` values. Let's count the number of `NA`s. Remember the `%>%` operator? Here we're going to be introduced to a few new things

  + the `apply()` function,
  + the `is.na()` function, and
  + how `R` deals with `logical` values!

```{r, message = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
penguins %>% 
  apply(.,2,is.na) %>%
  apply(.,2,sum)
```
There's lot going on in that code! Let's break it down

+ Take `penguins` then
+ Use `penguins` as an input to the `apply()` function (this is specified as the first argument using the `.`)
  + Now the `apply()` function takes 3 arguments: 
    1. the data object you want it to *apply* something to (in our case `penguins`)
    2. the margin you want to *apply* that something to; 1 stands for rows and 2 stands for columns, and
    3. the function you want it to apply (in our case `is.na()`).
  + So the second line of code is asking `R` to *apply* the `is.na()` function over the columns of `penguins`
    + `is.na()` asks for each value it's fed is it an `NA` value; it returns a `TRUE` if so and a `FALSE` otherwise
+ The output from the first `apply()` is then fed to the second `apply()` (using the `.`). The `sum()` function then add them up!
    + `R` treats a `TRUE` as a 1 and a `FALSE` as a 0.
    
So how many `NA`s do you think there are!

Doesn't help much. To

Now we know there are `NA` values throughout the data let's remove then and create a new `NA` free version called `penguins_nafree`. There is a really handy `tidyverse` (`dplyr`) function for this!

```{r}
penguins_nafree <- penguins %>% drop_na()
penguins_nafree
```

Below are some other useful manipulation functions; have a look at the outputs and run them yourselves and see if you can work out what they're doing.

```{r}
filter(penguins_nafree, island == "Torgersen" )
summarise(penguins_nafree, avgerage_bill_length = mean(bill_length_mm))
group_by(penguins_nafree, species)
```


Often we want to summarise variables by different groups (factors). Below we

+ Take the `penguins_nafree` data then
+ Use this and apply the `group_by()` function to group by `species`
+ Use this output and apply the `summarize()` function to calculate the mean (using (`mean()`) bill length (`bill_length_mm`) of each group (`species`), calling the resulting number `avgerage_bill_length`


```{r}
penguins_nafree %>% 
  group_by(species) %>% 
  summarise(avgerage_bill_length = mean(bill_length_mm))
```

We can also group by multiple factors, for example, 

```{r}
penguins_nafree %>% 
  group_by(island,species) %>% 
  summarise(avgerage_bill_length = mean(bill_length_mm))
```

**What about getting more complicated?**

I suggest you run the code below one pipe at a time to work out what each function is doing and data it is acting on.

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
penguins_nafree %>%
  filter(., sex != "male") %>%
  dplyr::select(c("species", "island", "body_mass_g")) %>%
  group_by(species, island) %>%
  summarise(total_mass_g = sum(body_mass_g)) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = c(island), values_from = total_mass_g)
```

### Exploratory plots

Exploratory plots are just *for you*, they

  + focus solely on data exploration,
  + don't have to look pretty,
  + just needs to get to the point,
  + explore and discover new data facets, and
  + help formulate new questions.
  
For example,
  
```{r example, me, echo = FALSE, fig.cap="", warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, fig.align='center'}
library(palmerpenguins)
penguins_nafree <- penguins %>% drop_na()
## scatter
ggplot(data = penguins_nafree, aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = bill_depth_mm, color = species)) +
  geom_point()
## histogram
ggplot(data = penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm)) +
  geom_histogram(aes(fill = species), alpha = 0.5, position = "identity")
```


### Explanatory plots

Explanatory plots are mainly *for others*. These are the most common kind of graph used in scientific publications. They should

   + have a clear purpose,
   + be designed for the audience,
   + be easy to read (*this covers a lot of things*),
   + not distort the data,
   + help guide the reader to a particular conclusion, 
   + answer a specific question, and
   + support an outlined  decision.
   
For example,

### Ten Simple Rules for Better Figures 

> "Scientific visualization is classically defined as the process of graphically displaying scientific data. However, this process is far from direct or automatic. There are so many different ways to represent the same data: scatter plots, linear plots, bar plots, and pie charts, to name just a few. Furthermore, the same data, using the same type of plot, may be perceived very differently depending on who is looking at the figure. A more accurate definition for scientific visualization would be a graphical interface between people and data." `r tufte::quote_footer('--- Nicolas P. Rougier, Michael Droettboom, Philip E. Bourne, Ten Simple Rules for Better Figures ')`

> "message and readability of the figure is the most important aspect while beauty is only an option" `r tufte::quote_footer('--- Nicolas P. Rougier, Michael Droettboom, Philip E. Bourne, Ten Simple Rules for Better Figures ')`

  + **Know** Your Audience
 
 + **Identify** Your Message
 
 + **Adapt** the Figure to the Support Medium
 
 + **Captions** Are Not Optional
 
 + **Do Not** Trust the Defaults
 
 + Use **Color** Effectively
 
 + **Do Not Mislead** the Reader
 
    + [There are formulas to measure how misleading a graph is!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misleading_graph)
    
 + **Avoid** *Chartjunk*
 
 + **Message** Trumps Beauty

 + Get the Right **Tool**
 
    + I'm an advocate for `R` `r emo::ji("wink")`
    
### `ggplot2`

`ggplot2` is an `R` package for producing statistical, or data, graphics; it has an underlying grammar based on the [Grammar of Graphics](https://www.amazon.com/Grammar-Graphics-Statistics-Computing/dp/0387245448)

Every `ggplot2` plot has three key components:

  + `data`,

  + A set of `aes`thetic mappings between variables in the data and visual properties, and

  + At least one layer which describes how to render each observation. Layers are usually created with a `geom` function.

#### Examples


**Scatter plot** using `geom_point()`

```{r flippoint,message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
ggplot(penguins,aes(x = body_mass_g, y = flipper_length_mm)) + ## data & aesthetics
    geom_point() + ## geom
  geom_smooth(method = 'lm', se = FALSE) ## statistics (linear regression line)
```

**Boxplot** using `geom_boxplot()` 

```{r flipbox2,message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
ggplot(penguins,aes(x = species, y = flipper_length_mm)) + ## data & aesthetics
    geom_boxplot()  + ## geom
  ggtitle("Flipper length (mm) by species") +
  ylab("Flipper length (mm)") +

**Scatter plot** specifying `color` using `geom_point()`

```{r flippoint2, message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
ggplot(penguins,aes(x = body_mass_g, y = flipper_length_mm, color = species)) + ## data and aesthetics
    geom_point() + ## geom
