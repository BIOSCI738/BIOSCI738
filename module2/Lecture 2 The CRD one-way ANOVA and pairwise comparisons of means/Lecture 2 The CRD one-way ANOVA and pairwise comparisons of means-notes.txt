 E ≤ m  C ; For m = 3, choose  E ≤ 0.05. Therefore,  C  0.05/3 = 0.0167. Get adjust t-statistic, i.e. for two-tailed test: qt(1-0.05/6, 8) = 3.02

K = no. of groups q = Studentized range statistic M L = largest sample mean M S = smallest sample mean q = (M L – M S )/ sqrt (MSE/r) Where MSE = within-groups MS (from ANOVA) r = no. of reps per group [Aside: If the groups sizes are unequal, can put r = harmonic mean of the group sizes] In our example, MSE = 0.6732 and r = 4. The Sham and Pancreatitis group means are M C = 8.46 and M P = 8.95, respectively. Thus, q = (8.95 – 8.46)/ sqrt (0.6732/4) = 1.194412 This Studentized range statistic belongs to a sampling distribution defined by two parameters: the first is k , the number of samples in the original analysis; and the second is df , the number of degrees of freedom associated with the denominator of the F -ratio in the original analysis. We can get the q-critical values from the sampling distribution. Now, the HSD for Tukey’s method is [q ; k, n-k / sqrt (2)]* sqrt (2*MSE/r). But, for the Tukey -Kramer method, for unequal sample sizes, HSD = [q ; k, n-k / sqrt (2)]* sqrt (MSE*(1/r i +1/ r j )). So, in the above, q* = q 0.05; 3,9 / sqrt (2) = 2.792 Using R: > qtukey (0.95, nmeans =3, df =9) [1] 3.948492 > qtukey (0.95, nmeans =3, df =9)/ sqrt (2) [1] 2.792006 > (11.5475-8.95)-( qtukey (0.95, nmeans =3, df =9)/ sqrt (2))* sqrt (2*0.6732/4) [1] 0.9776554
