## Accuracy and Honesty

Honesty is an expectation: we expect honesty from you and you expect the same from your teaching team. Honesty is an expectation in any scientific discipline as is accuracy. These are morals, ethical principles we should abide by. But this course isn't here to discuss philosophy or character development. This course, in particular this section of the course, aims to expose you to the tools and principles that will aid you in your own pursuit of ethical data practice. Teaching you the tools so that your analysis is reproducible goes someway towards ensuring accuracy in your research. This because, reproducibility promotes transparency, facilitates error detection and correction, and contributes to the overall reliability and accuracy of your research findings.

### Reproducible research

> "Reproducibility, also known as replicability and repeatability, is a major principle underpinning the scientific method. For the findings of a study to be reproducible means that results obtained by an experiment or an observational study or in a statistical analysis of a data set should be achieved again with a high degree of reliability when the study is replicated. ... With a narrower scope, reproducibility has been introduced in computational sciences: Any results should be documented by making all data and code available in such a way that the computations can be executed again with identical results." `r tufte::quote_footer('--- Reprodicibility, Wikipedia')`


Reproducibility is a stepping stone towards ensuring accuracy. This is because, reproducibility promotes transparency, facilitates error detection and correction, and contributes to the overall reliability and accuracy of your research findings. Establishing *good practice* when dealing with data and code right from the beginning is essential. Good practice 1) ensures that data is collected, processed, and stored accurately and consistently, which helps maintain the quality and integrity of the data throughout its lifecycle; and 2) creates a robust code base, which can be easily understood and adapted as the project progresses, which leads to faster development.

### Good coding practice


You should **always start with a clean workspace**. **Why?** *So your ex (code) can't come and mess up your life!* 

To ensure that RStudio does not load up your previous workspace go to **Tools** > **Global Options** and uncheck the highlighted options below. 
<p align="center">![](https://miro.medium.com/max/2784/1*dUNl71Jic2zYhYS2hxOBZA.png){width="40%"}</p>

The reasoning may not be immediately obvious; however, it is something you will later regret if you don't start as you mean to go on! Loading up a previous workspace may seem convenient as your previous objects and code are immediately on-hand. However, this is the exact reason that it is not good practice, loading up a previous workspace is **NOT** reproducible, does **NOT** create a fresh `R` process, makes your script vulnerable, and it **will** come back to bite you.

A project-oriented workflow in `R` refers to a structured approach to organizing and managing your code, data, and analyses. This helps improve reproducibility and the overall efficiency of your work. Within this it is essential essential to write code that is easy to understand, maintain, and share. To do so, coding best practice is to follow the **5 Cs** by being

1. **Clear**
   - *Code Clarity:* Write code that is easy to read and understand. Use meaningful variable and function names that convey the purpose of the code. Avoid overly complex or ambiguous expressions.
   - *Comments:* Include comments to explain the purpose of your code, especially for complex or non-intuitive sections. Comments should add value without stating the obvious.

2. **Concise:**
   - *Avoid Redundancy:* Write code in a way that avoids unnecessary repetition. Reuse functions and use loops or vectorized operations when appropriate to reduce the length of your code.
   - *Simplify Expressions:* Simplify complex expressions and equations to improve readability. Break down complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps.

3. **Consistent:**
   - *Coding Style:* Adhere to a consistent coding style throughout your project. Consistency in indentation, spacing, and naming conventions makes the code visually coherent.
   - *Function Naming:* Keep naming conventions consistent. If you use camelCase for variable names, continue to use it consistently across your codebase.

4. **Correct:**
   - *Error Handling:* Implement proper error handling to ensure that your code gracefully handles unexpected situations. Check for potential issues, and provide informative error messages.
   - *Testing:* Test your code to ensure it produces the correct output. Use tools like unit tests (e.g., with `testthat`) to verify that your functions work as intended.

5. **Conformant:**
   - *Follow Best Practices:* Adhere to best practices and coding standards in the R community. For example, follow the tidyverse style guide or the Google R Style Guide.
   - *Package Guidelines:* If you're creating an R package, conform to package development guidelines. Use the `usethis` package to help set up your package structure in a conformant way.

</div>

There are many other good practice tips when it comes to coding these include ensuring your code is modular, implementing unit testing, automating workflows and implementing version control. In this course you will be using `git` to manage your project code and data. Use of `git`, or similar, will very likely be an expectation of your future career, see [Version control with `git` and GitHub] for an introduction to these tools.

#### File naming policies

| Item                            | What                                                    | Why                                                                      |

## Version control with `git` and GitHub


Git is a version control system that manages the evolution of a set of files, called a repository (repo), in a structured way (think of Word's Track Changes). With `git` you can track the changes you make to your project/code. You will **always** have a record of what you've worked on and can easily revert back to an older version if you make a mistake. GitHub is a hosting service that provides a home for your `git`-based projects on the internet (think of Dropbox). In addition, GitHub offers functionality to use `git` online via an easy-to-use interface. Both `git` and GitHub can very easily be configured to work with RStudio.
  
Below are some key terms you will undoubtedly hear when delving into the git--GitHub world.

**Repository** (already mentioned) This where the work happens--think of it as your project folder. It should contain all of your projectâ€™s files etc.

**Cloning** A repository on GitHub is stored remotely in the cloud. To create a local copy of this repository you can clone it and use Git to sync the two.

**Committing** and **pushing** are how you can add the changes you made on your local machine to the remote repository in GitHub. You can make a commit when you have made milestone worthy changes to your project. You should also add a helpful commit message to remind future you, or your teammates, what the changes you made were (e.g., fixed the bug in my_function).


The table below gives [Ten Simple Rules for Taking Advantage of Git and GitHub](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004947), which outline how to get the most out of using these softwares.

  <strong>TASK</strong> Read [Ten Simple Rules for Taking Advantage of Git and GitHub](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004947) and briefly expand on the points above using examples from your studies/careers to-date.

</div>

### Setting up

 1.  Register an account with GitHub [https://github.com](https://github.com). Choose the free option!
 2.  Make sure you've got the latest version of `R`
```{r version}
R.version.string
```
 3. Upgrade `RStudio` to the [new preview version](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/preview/) (*optional*)
 4. Install git: follow [these instructions](https://happygitwithr.com/install-git.html)
 5. [Get started](https://happygitwithr.com/hello-git.html)

### Cloning a repository from `GitHub` using `RStudio`

  1. In `GitHub`, navigate to the Code tab of the repository and on the right side of the screen, click `Clone or download`.
  2. Click the `Copy to clipboard` icon to the right of the repository URL 
  <p align="center">![](img/gh_code.png){width="50%"}</p>
  
  3. Open `RStudio` in your local environment
  4. Click `File`, `New Project`, `Version Control`, `Git`
  <p align="center">![](img/rstudio_new_project.png){width="40%"}![](img/rstudio_git.png){width="40%"}</p>
  
  5. Paste the repository URL and enter TAB to move to the `Project directory name` field.
  <p align="center">![](img/rstudio_clone.png){width="50%"}</p>
  
  6.Click `Create Project`. Your *Files* pane should now look similar to this
  <p align="center">![](img/files.png){width="50%"}</p>

### Commiting and pushing changes

 1. Open a file from your project directory (here I've opened the file `README.md`). Note that the `Git` pane (top right) is empty
 
 <p align="center">![](img/git_push_setup.png){width="60%"}</p>
 
 2. Make a change to your file and save. Now note that the `Git` pane (top right) is not empty:
 
 <p align="center">![](img/git_staged.png){width="50%"}</p>
 
 3. Check this file in the `Git` tab (it is now *staged* for commit).
 
 4. Click the **Commit** button. A new pane will open. Changes made to the file will be highlighted (additions in green and deletions in red). Now write your self an **informative** message in the top right of this pop-up:
 
 <p align="center">![](img/git_commit.png){width="60%"}</p>
 
 5. Click the **Commit** button below the message you've just written. A new pop up will let you know how things are going! You can then close both popups.
 
 <p align="center">![](img/git_commit_popup.png){width="50%"}</p>
 
 6. Now you'll see RStudio has left you a little message in the `Git` tab, something similar to `Your branch is ahead of origin/master by 1 commit`. This means that you've made and committed your changes locally (i.e., on your computer) but you are yet to **push** these changes to GitHub.
 
 7. To **push** to GitHub press the **Push** button, ![](img/push.png){width=10%}
 
 8. A new pop up will let you know how things are going! You can then close this once it gives you the option to.
 
  <p align="center">![](img/git_push.png){width="50%"}</p>
 

### System specific hurdles

As with any new software there are likely to be a few teething issues! Below are some previous classmate's solutions^[Zhao Cao, Weiran Jin, and Jack Blackwood from the 2023 cohort] to issues encountered when commiting and pushing changes using `git` via RStudio. These initial issues are likely due to authentication. 

#### Windows `config` file

Assuming your current working directory is at the top level of your repo/project then choose the **Files** tab in your plotting pane. 

 1. Then choose  the <i class="fas fa-cog"></i>**More** tab and the **Show Hidden Files** option:

 ![](img/hidden_files.png)

 2. Navigate to the `.git` folder and open the file named `config`:
 
 ![](img/config.png)
 
 3. Open `config` and add the following code replacing the relevant bits with your GitHub username/handle and email.
 
```
[user]

name = <adding your GitHub username here>

email = <adding your GitHub email here>
```

 4. Save the changes to this file and you should be all good to commit!
 
#### Personal Access Token authentication (linking GitHub to your project)


Using your Github email and password as authentication was decommissioned a while ago. Instead a Personal Access Token is required.

 1. Sign into [Github](github.com) and follow these instructions to create a [Personal Access Token](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server@3.9/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens#creating-a-personal-access-token)
 
 2. Once completed a new popup will appear with what looks like a random jumble of letters and numbers (in the format `ghp_*************`), this is your Personal Access Token. **Copy this! Or put it in your notes, or password manager, for later**
 
 3. Return to RStudio clone your desired repository (e.g., the one for the assignment):
 
   + Create a New Project
   + Click on Version Control
   + Click on Git
   + Enter the URL from the repository link from Canvas
   + Make a name for the project (or just use the default)
   + Click Create
   
You will now be asked for your GitHub details:

  + When asked for your username type your GitHub account username/handle
  + When asked for your password, input the **Personal Access Token** you just created, not your GitHub account password
  
  
Note, depending on the choices you made when creating your Personal Access Token, it may run out (the default duration is 30 days) and your authentication stop working. No worries, simply [create a new one one](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server@3.9/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens#creating-a-personal-access-token) use this as your password!
